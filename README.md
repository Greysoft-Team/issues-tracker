# Greysoft Issues Tracker
Track and resolve issues discovered in build processes within the Greysoft working envoronment.

## Why
 
During the course of working as part of the tech team, we encounter several issues, bugs and setbacks, most times we find promt solutions either with a simple google search or through a much rather complex debugging process, whichever is the case, when you eventually find the solution to your problem this repo would serve as a central error tracking solution seeing that the solution to you problems might also be applicable to some other person.

Where for any reason you were unable to find any solution to the problem, other individuals with a much broader scope of experience can step in to help.

## How

Simply go to the issues tab and click on the **New Issue** button.
When describing your issue, the folling should be taken into consideration:
